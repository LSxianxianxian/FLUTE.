First he's never seen, surprises he's always.	1
First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past.	1
First, the pupils, teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers; second, school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys, not girls; third, classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity, and finally it has been suggested that â scientific thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view.	1

For Sartre's singular universal could never be expected to solve the formal theoretical problem of how individual existential existence can be related to History insofar as it simply renames, in one oxymoronic category, the original antithetical terms.	0
For a more girl friendly science, it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging, evident in textbooks and resources as well as teachers' and boys' behaviour in the classroom, is removed, girls can be very enthusiastic about science. â¦	1
For a place so hated, the Pontypool plant looks innocuous inside, like a cross between an oil refinery and a crematorium.	0
For a whole week they had worked closely together, sharing flasks of coffee and packets of cigarettes and Paula had grown to like the pixieish little man who by his very nature offered her no challenge â and no threat.	1
For all his use of the model of the boxing match, Sartre has really got no further with the fundamental question of how there can be totalization without a totalizer.	1
For example Roe( 1952), Eiduson( 1962) and McClelland( 1962) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood, perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances, so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships.	0
For example, girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships, seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature, while boys are more exploitative.	1
For example, lack of discipline in the home, genetic defects, poverty, mixing with the â wrong sort have all been proposed as causes of criminality.	1
For example, lower working-class people are more likely to be mesomorphic as a result of their diet and continual manual labour, and this class grouping is more likely to be found represented in the criminal statistics.	1
For example, they take the view that â criminals should be severely punished or that â anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate.	1
For numerous studies have shown that a high percentage of the population have committed criminal offences, in particular high proportions of juveniles, and it is difficult to believe that they are all different or abnormal.	1
For once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits on Wavebreaker, for Jackson Chatterton's drug clinic had utterly forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol, saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme.	1

For the first time she felt the stirrings of something like power.	0
For the nuclear element in electricity privatisation is the coping stone on which the flotation plans are based.	1
For the whole basis of Sartre's argument is that the dialectic of history is not a metaphysical law, â some powerful unitary force revealing itself behind History like the will of God, but the continuously produced effect of individual conflicts; each action is in its turn subsumed as a part of the whole in an ever broader, developing totalization( I, 37).	1
For the â dogmatic dialectic, as he describes dialectical materialism, the whole question naturally poses no problem, for each person or group simply constitutes a partial moment of an already operative movement of totalization that produces them and then goes beyond them.	1

Furthermore Madame Mattli was a Frenchwoman, an accident of birth which added to her glamour, for was not Paris the fashion capital of the world?	0
Furthermore, if criminals are abnormal then it follows that a large proportion of the population must also be abnormal.	1
Furthermore, it has been found that the association between delinquency on the one hand and height, weight and physique on the other is greatly reduced once social, background factors are taken into account.	1
Furthermore, the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences.	1
Furthermore, these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image, one which already attracts many girls.	1

Girls Into Science and Technology( GIST) was the first major schools-based project addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school, and was an example of â action research in education; the project simultaneously took action to improve girls' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reasons for their under-achievement.	1
Girls are not uninterested in science, they are bored by the limited version of it they meet in school.	1
Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking, although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive.	0
Girls had far less â tinkering experience than boys and the connection with their lesser interest in topics like â how electricity is produced seemed obvious.	0

He admits killing the DO.	1
He already knew about that.	0
He always gets like that and then he forgets after like a month or two when he hasn't worked for him.	0
He asserts it often enough: â History continually effects totalisations of totalisations,( I, 15).	0
He attempts to solve this through matching his account of contradiction with a new concept derived from the conjunction of work and labour: â anti-labour( anti-travail), a category of negation.	1

He is descended from Mbatian.	1
He is even re-opening the already opened Eastern Harbour tunnel and subway crossing.	1
He is finally rejected by the devious, arrogant Keith, who informs him that he is â obsolete because he does not â know how to make things happen.	1

He is perhaps surprised by her composure.	1
He is right to pursue this line.	1

He needs to be for the next four days in Hong Kong, because he will be hard at work cutting ribbons and laying foundation stones.	0
He noted that the Canberra meeting â is the start of something which could grow into a very significant development not only for the region but for the global economy.	1

Her accent reminded Paula of Louise â perhaps that was why she warmed to her in spite of the fact that she was so awe-inspiring.	1
Her dark, grey-streaked hair, which she wore in a long bob, had been cut by Vidal Sassoon and she wore a beautifully tailored black suit relieved only by a little white flounce at the neckline.	1
Her face is shaded from him in the failing light.	0
Her face, as she removes her hat and begins to speak, is startlingly beautiful, although not conventionally.	0
Her favourite was the coffee shop in Fenwicks in Bond Street for this was the haunt and the meeting place of all those from the world of fashion.	0
Her long hair, shining gold, was swept back and caught at the nape of her neck with a bow, make-up, expertly applied, accentuated the classically beautiful lines of her face, and she wore her well-cut suit with all the panache that was expected of her.	1

His History, therefore, is always in process: but its teleology of a final totalization always has to be assumed.	1
His brother was killed.	0
His difficulty is accompanied by a no doubt symptomatic increasing distrust of universals so that, in championing specificities against them, he seems to give up the attempt to validate the universals â History as Totalization â that originally formed the object of his project.	1
His district stretches nearly one hundred and fifty miles.	1
His face is painted and he is carrying a spear.	0
His mother, by contrast, is the most vividly realised character in the book: nervy, flirtatious and selfish, already on her third husband, she thinks primarily of her appearance, even when visiting her dying daughter, Francis's twin.	0
His records are still played, but his personality, unexposed through movies or extensive TV interviews, is almost entirely unknown.	0
His response to this rejection is as flat as his reaction to the massive demonstration which Keith has earlier persuaded him to join against the Vietnam War.	1
His scepticism goes to the extent of even denying the existence of â society or â the nation as such( II, 24, 61) â the very totalities which his own general argument for totalization requires.	1
His view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide.	0
Hobbes does not tell us, but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have.	1
Hobbes is not using an inductive argument here; the â possibility apparent is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones.	1
Hold on to this	0
Holt and Harris both, in the end, face the same problem.	1
Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do, and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them.	1
Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark:	1
How can History be a unity if it is also conflictual, if each action is aimed at destroying the other and results in a double negation in which the original aims of each action have been destroyed by the other?	1
How can man make history if at the same time it is history which makes him?	1

However, it is patently obvious that parents can be a good or bad influence and example for their children, and this fact can hardly be used to explain present patterns of crime.	1
However, only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school.	1
However, psychological causes are seen as treatable, whereas biological causes mark the individual for life.	1

However, very few of the teachers even recognized the issue as one of professional concern at the start of the project, and most of the first two years was spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategies.	1
However, when he poses the question of whether his method could work as well for the class struggle as for the boxing match, Sartre admits that he finds it impossible to answer and returns instead to the much easier case of sub-groups.	1

I had no idea, Paula said, surprised she had not already heard the news.	0
I had nothing particular planned, merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean, though, mindful of the danger of tropical storms, I had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a Bahamian hurricane hole.	1

I like sailing alone at night.	0
I like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits a path across an empty planet.	1
I like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness, when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn, which seems like a betrayal because, at night, in a boat under sail, it is easy to feel very close to God â for eternity is all around.	1
I like the sounds of a boat sailing at night.	0
I like to be alone under the careless profusion of the stars, and alone on a moon-glossed sea.	0

If a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences.	1
If by 1945 Merleau-ponty had here already indicated the historical basis for what was to become Sartre's project in the Critique, the theoretical problem that followed was how to unite orthodox Marxist concepts of economic determinism and historical necessity with the individualism of Sartre's earlier work, that is the existentialist notion of the authentic self and the possibility of choosing one's own freedom: how to relocate human practice within historical determinism, to reconcile the individual with the social, the idea of agency with that of necessity, or freedom with history?	1
If each action negates the aim of the other, where is the â unity totalized in the conflict?	0

If the more economically puny ASEAN countries( Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Thailand and the Philippines) were to bury their reservations, then the high growth from other partners, including such tigers as Thailand and South Korea alongside the more mature economies of Japan and Australia, could mean a dynamic coalition.	1

If you rely to your detriment on a misleading reference which was given negligently, you should be able to sue the referee.	1
If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational, and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are.	1
If you were a gambling man it would not affect you, it would just be lost.	1
If, on the other hand, you allow rationality to children, then you can not use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults.	1
In 1986, according to Friends of the Earth, a survey of the homes clustered on the surrounding hills found that three-quarters of 800 residents were opposed to the Rechem plant.	1
In 1987, aluminium melted in the furnace, reacted with water and exploded, sending a black cloud over nearby houses.	1
In April 1985 a tanker spilled 200 litres of PCBs over the main Trans-Canada Highway on the border between Ontario and Manitoba.	1
In Britain, with the main exception of Blackpool( not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno), trams had been largely relegated to the history books.	0
In Chapter One, it was stressed that crime can not be considered aside from its social context, that it is dependent on society defining certain actions as criminal, and on the reaction of others to such actions.	1
In Escape from Childhood( 1974), John Holt notes that children are, in fact, capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be.	1
In Liverpool, a dockers' spokesman with the Transport and General Workers Union admitted: â Drivers aren't happy handling some of these commodities, but at least a lorry-driver has more idea of what he is handling than a docker, who could have a consignment and just not know what it is.	0
In May last year the Court of Appeal upheld a judgment against the friend for more than £5,500 damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care.	0
In Milan, for example, the commission to design the new generation of â Jumbo trams, which went into service in 1979, was one that leading Italian architects and designers fought over.	1
In a bare, mud-walled cell, sitting on the floor, is Tepilit.	0
In a desperately competitive climate, where anyone bright and competent could go down the road and pick up a better paid job with kinder hours and more congenial working conditions from someone like British Telecom, the railways ran a service dependent on people who belonged to a narrow and inbred working culture, with outdated procedures of training and promotion, and an institutional reliance on overtime working, whose wholly disgraceful dimensions are symbolised by the fact that maximum weekly hours were only recently cut to 72 hours a week.	1
In a large, prefabricated shed we wandered past stacks of 45-gallon drums of PCBs, two drums high, about 10 deep; and there were contaminated transformers waiting to be cut up and roasted in the flames.	1
In a major study of institutionalised delinquents( delinquents in some form of custody) in the USA in the 1950s, Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck found that delinquent boys were twice as likely to have a mesomorphic build, a chunky, muscular, compared with non-delinquent boys.	1
In a small way at the moment, of course, but things are happening.	0
In a tone of meek appeasement, the letter draws attention to the arrest by Hong Kong police of anti-China demonstrators outside the agency's National Day reception.	1
In all the time she had been with her Paula had never seen her so angry.	0
In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture; Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection.	1
In any case, if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it.	1
In any case, it would be dishonest to pretend that Mill-type consequences are not relevant here.	0
In contrast, boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as â My main problem is â¦ and â He/she felt proud that â¦.	1
In contrast, only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens.	1
In contrast, other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group.	0
In doing so, they underlined a fact which is likely to attract more and more attention as tankers continue to shift toxins from town to town, country to country: the waste chain is long.	1
In effect, ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine.	1
In either case, the political implication is that denying rights to children is entirely justified, and there the matter rests.	1
In fact I have just been looking at a place in South Audley Street, not far from Mattli.	0
In fact yesterday we said I wonder if he's got a new car or whether he's got visitors.	1
In fact, most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice.	1
In front of the building is a row of white-painted stones and some cactus-like sisal plants forming a circle around a patch of grass.	0
In hard hats and protective glasses, we walked past the huge â fume cupboard where the most noxious barrels are opened, and arrived at the vast, closed mouth of the furnace itself.	0
In here, they burn about 30,000 tonnes of chemicals a year, a quarter originating outside Britain.	0
In his book L'Uomo Delinquente, Lombroso developed a complex description of what he called the â born criminal, who could be recognised by a variety of physical characteristics, in particular facial characteristics â for example large jaws and ears, and high cheek bones.	1
In his eagerness to depict the cloudy psychology of an adolescent, Motion has forgotten to give the boy a personality.	1
In his hands he holds a snuff box, shaped like a small quiver, and a thin stick.	0
In his uniform, jacket unzipped, he is handsome and smiling.	0
In one way I loved them all.	0
In our country to exchange gifts does not mean the same thing.	1
In recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success.	1
In relation to the sentence stem â A girl and her mother â¦, girls often produce responses like â often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other, become the best of friends or â can help each other with their problems.	1
In some cases Labour's quangos merge existing ones, or replace well-established bodies.	1
In such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others.	0
In that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them.	1

In the context of the negativity of this formulation, Sartre is obliged to pose once again the problem of whether there can be a totalization, without any independent totalizer or totalizing force such as the dialectic, or whether the structure of negation that he has described means that, as for Adorno or Bakhtin, history does not develop positively but, rather, negatively, and is therefore instead detotalizing:	0
In the days that followed, the Tysons found that they and 18,000 other investors had been the victims of a financial crash of global proportions.	1
In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish, hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut.	1
In the dialectical perspective, we encounter these objects as productions which are human and provided with a future â¦ thus they seem by themselves to be totalizations in process.	1
In the distance we can hear cowbells.	0
In the fitting rooms at Taylors she fussed and fretted over her creations like a mother hen and though Paula was overawed by the great designer she also liked her on sight.	0

In the long hours when there were no customers to show she was expected to lend a hand with some of the unskilled tasks â running errands and making tea, unpicking a seam or a hem, even sewing on a button or a hook and eye when she had been taught the proper way to do it.	1
In the meantime, don't forget your friends, eh Paula?	0
In the medical faculty at the University of Rome there is a gallery of portraits of splendidly ugly delinquents who were used to illustrate Lombroso's theory.	1
In the middle of the grass is a flagpole from which the Union Jack hangs.	0
In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career.	0
In this case Sartre demonstrates how the singular universal works, by appealing to the concrete example of a boxing match â a random exemplification that just happens to reproduce the single adversaries of the master/slave dialectic.	1
In those cases there is no possible treatment, one is born a criminal.	0
In training for youth, the child must be given reasons; in the training of the infant for childhood this can not be done.	1

It is a curiously paradoxical foundation uponupon which to build a theory of autonomy.	1
It is a good time to plant hardy shrubs too.	0
It is all standard royal stuff, but not much help to the millions who fear that Hong Kong will not remain open after 1997.	0
It is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought.	1

It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education( 1979) policy statement in Britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the Institute for Science Education( IPN) in Kiel are advocating such changes.	1
It is no accident that the liberation of women, such as it is, should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general; liberation for one part of the â not-men is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you.	1
It is not clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to, but Holt clearly does not.	0
It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child.	1
It is not that prospects for earnings are 10 p.c. better that they were in the middle of last week, but it is possible to argue that prospects are that much better than they would have been under a Labour government and that the market was discounting such a result.	1
It is only too obvious that this balance between action and personal life was intimately bound up with the conditions of clandestine action and could not survive it.	1
It is sad, and somewhat ominous, that so little of that should have been reflected in the sombre statement which Mr Parkinson made in the House yesterday ..	1
It is simple enough for him to show that a boxing match takes place within a general totality of â boxing, which is itself only ever present in any individual incarnation, for as a game each match is both an individual bout and something conducted according to general rules and a specific social tradition.	1
It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they can not choose the goals or that they can not form strategies to achieve them or both.	1
It is therefore, Sartre argues, our historical task to make it known, promoting not just the historical process as such, but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history, with one meaning â the â Truth of humanity( I, 822).	1
It is well established that in the delinquent-prone, home discipline is more liable to be too lax, strict or erratic.	0
It looked like that, didn't it?	0
It made her feel strong, invincible almost, and just a tiny bit as if she had drunk too much wine.	1
It makes a conveniently central hub: the Marais Poitevin village of Coulon is 27 miles to the north by the D120, which inexplicably changes its number at the top of a hill to D115.	1
It may also be possible to claim damages against a local authority for negligently failing to ensure that construction work complied with the relevant building regulations.	1
It may be that tougher-looking delinquents are more liable to be put away than fragile looking ones.	1
It might be for Wisbech one, they've gone to, cos erm, I mean they've got two at Lynn, so it must be Wisbech	1

It was Paula's job to show samples, parading slowly up and down in front of the clients as they sat on the elegant spindle-leg chairs taking in every detail of the garments with a critical and practised eye.	1
It was clear she was blaming Paula bitterly for the interrupted afternoon and her boss's drastic change of mood.	0
It was not quite what she envisaged for herself but it had the advantage of being cheap and it went some way towards satisfying Grace, who was convinced that London was a den of iniquity waiting to swallow up her unsuspecting daughter.	1
It was not unlike the feeling she experienced when men looked at her and wanted her though she knew it could not be that for there was nothing sexual between her and Gary and never would be.	0
It was so unusual for him to contribute anything to the conversation that Paula glanced at him in surprise.	1
It was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement.	1

It would be naive to expect to uncover any ultimate explanation or basic cause for criminal behaviour, given the extensive and diverse behaviour that is encompassed by the term crime.	1
It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them, the one does not entail the other, but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens.	1
It would be well to know just what this entails.	1
It would then be up to the US and Canada to decide whether they want to face towards the Atlantic or Pacific â or be caught between two great trading oceans.	1
It would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children.	1

Its most surprising room, covered from ceiling to floor in 17th-century paintings, should be a salon or library; instead, a dotty stone bathtub was set into one wall at a later date by a lady called Charlotte.	0
Its remit for inter-departmental intrusion would be wide, with â a watching brief over government action and the ability to initiate consumer legislation.	1

Male scientists, both science students and mature, professional scientists, tend to be emotionally reticent, disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves, and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives.	1

Maslow( 1966) and Hudson( 1966 and 1968) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence.	1

Not all problems have gone away of course: yesterday's £6.4 billion public sector borrowing requirement is not much higher than expectations, but it is almost as large as the deficit for the previous 11 months and â with this year's deficit forecast to be double last year's â shows why the Bank of England so eagerly sold £2 billion or more of gilts on election night and why it needs a regular stream of massive sales.	1

Now the Marais Poitevin is a pleasantly low-profile tourist attraction where you can take canal-boat trips from villages that have hardly changed in the 15-odd years I've known them: Maillezais, with a huge and rather dull ruined abbey, and Coulon, where I first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade.	1

Sartre considered that orthodox dialectical materialism takes the easy way out by merely eliminating the first in favour of the second, making man a passive product entirely determined by economic circumstances.	1
Sartre does not attempt to answer this question, shifting rather to the notion of a lack of self-consciousness.	1
Sartre produces a persuasive formulation of the relation of the individual to the determining historical circumstance through his concepts of praxis and the practico-inert; it is also obvious to him how the larger question of History ought to be solved.	1
Sartre's account thus sets up the articulation of history, univocal meaning, and totality as the indissoluble set of elements required for the validation of Marxism, necessary in order to save it from its detour from itself.	1
Sartre's fundamental thesis, that â History continually effects totalisations of totalisations( I, 15), does not in itself answer what Ronald Aronson has rightly characterized as the question for Sartre: â how do separate, antagonistic actions yield a history; how do individual totalizations lead to Totalization( and also progress, the direction of history, its truth and its meaning)?	1
Sartre's reaction to the threat that the negation of a negation may produce a detotalizing effect is to introduce a new category, a unifying force of a â singularization which incarnates the universal: â If totalization really is an ongoing process, he writes, â then it operates everywhere.	1
Sartre's stress on the role of the subject also finds approval because many of those no longer prepared to argue for a general theory of history as the progress of a single narrative of class-struggle, have begun to argue instead for a return of its correlative, the subject, almost as if it was the next best thing in the absence of history itself.	1
Sartre's â singular universal, therefore, begs the question, for it is predicated on the assumption that, if there is not a totality as such, then there already is an overall totalization: â If totalization really is an ongoing process â¦.	1

Since it can not be known as a concept that will realize itself in the future, Sartre argues instead that the totality only produces itself in the moment: â The incarnation as such is at once unrealizable except as totalization of everything and irreducible to a pure abstract unity of that which it totalizes( II, 58).	1

So, although it is possible to conceive of any event as an incarnation of the totality, insofar as it must itself make up a part of that totality in its determination, unlike the case of the boxing match, where we can define the overall entity â boxing, it still remains unproven that an overall entity, â History, can be said to exist at all.	1

Such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices, helps to construct them, and is in turn constructed by them.	1

The FT-SE failed to hold its gains yesterday but shortly after opening it was only six points away from last September's previous record closing level.	1
The GIST hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed by the school, an hypothesis based on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis( see, for example, Kelly, 1981).	1
The GIST interventions described above relate to three of these: VISTA women, albeit briefly and temporarily, redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists; VISTA and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited â repackaging of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal, and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as â masculine in the mixed school.	1
The Health Secretary accused the unions of â posturing and pretending to run a 999 service yesterday.	1
The House of Mattli is expanding from couture into ready-to-wear and one of the big Bristol stores, Taylors, are putting on a show to publicise the fact that they will be stocking the new prªt-¨-porter', Arlene explained.	1

The Resistance was a unique experience for them, and they wanted to preserve its experience in the new French politics because this experience broke away from the famous dilemma of being and doing, which confronts all intellectuals in the face of action â¦.	1

The adolescent does not, however, need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time.	0
The appearance of a famous face in the show rooms always caused a stir amongst the girls, who all longed to hook a wealthy husband â and if he had a title, like the Aly Khan, or was a film star like Omar Shariff, then so much the better!	1
The approach was collaborative: teachers were invited to work with the team as equal partners in the attempts both to investigate and find solutions to the GIST problem.	1
The askaris wear military sweaters, Sam Brownes, shorts and socks.	0
The assumption that all groups in the â not-men class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, for example, some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children.	1
The attacks are based on empirical observation; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational.	1
The author's job is not merely to offer an illustrated Who's Who entry, but to turn elements of a man's life into a dramatic entity.	1

The company's figures imply that when you have burnt 99.9999 per cent of a 30,000-tonne annual throughput, a figure of 0.03 of a tonne remains.	1
The concept of the singular universal thus facilitates a circularity in the argument whereby Sartre can avoid the question which he began by posing.	1

The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others.	1
The dialectic is the law of totalization which creates several collectivities, several societies, and one history â realities, that is, which impose themselves on individuals; but at the same time it must be woven out of millions of individual actions.	1
The dialectic is the law that remains hidden.	0
The difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science, if we want to recruit a different sort of student, then certain curriculum changes are needed.	1
The disaster was all the more stunning because people had come to assume that such things didn't happen.	1

The fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and, no doubt, the reasons for this were largely social.	1

The first, albeit tenative, steps towards forming a new Pacific-based economic union display an astute awareness of the way events are moving within Europe: movements with which Number 10 has yet to come to grips.	1
The fourth point, the idea that science is intrinsically masculine, can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking.	1

The great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter.	1
The hero, Francis Mayne, is suffering from the adolescent's emotional confusion and acute self-consciousness.	0
The ideal tactics should be a mixture of both, but only if a clear message can be communicated to the Hong Kong people that someone is standing up for them somewhere.	1
The immature deliberative faculty will mature; children have the â possibility apparent of turning into rational beings( Hobbes); they love to be reated as though they were rational though they are not so yet( Locke); you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles( Kant).	1
The increase will not be matched by dividend rises â too many companies have been paying more than they could afford over the past two years and need to repair their reserves and ratios â but 7 p.c. growth looks reasonable.	1
The individual criminal is born so; and this is usually put down to â faulty chromosome patterns, or, more vaguely, to â hereditary traits.	1

The largest scale intervention was the VISTA programme, which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect of their jobs already being covered in the school science syllabus.	1
The less immediately attractive parts of science could be approached through these interests, for instance teaching â forces by beginning with the action of muscles in the human arm, and â light via the dissection of a bull's eye.	1

The lower reaches of the Sevre Niortaise are swollen with the waters that once covered the whole area, until medieval monks started to dig a spider-web of ditches to drain it.	0
The major problem faced by theories suggesting a link between genetic make-up and criminal behaviour is the difficulty of distinguishing between genetic and environmental effects.	1
The major question thus always remains unanswered in the Critique: every time that Sartre announces that he is about to proceed with the fundamental problem of how History can be a totalization without a totalizer, he turns back to a previous, more easily intelligible stage on the way.	1
The majority of offenders do not come from disturbed or broken homes, and many broken homes do not produce delinquents.	1
The market yield, a historic 4 p.c., could return back above 5 p.c., therefore giving basic-rate taxpayers a real return with the prospect of real growth too.	1
The market's price-earnings multiple was 16 last night but it would drop below 14 if that increase in earnings really happens.	1

The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights, privileges, duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them.	0
The predominance of males, particularly in the physical sciences and engineering, throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences, which are too small, nor to institutional factors.	0
The preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid, authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists.	1
The prison has a medical block with 24 beds and a gym with equipment that staff said would be the envy of many council leisure centres.	1
The probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals.	1
The problem with assessing the influence of parental and family dimensions, such as weak supervision or parental criminality, is the fact that they are closely linked to various aspects of social and economic disadvantage, such as poverty, overcrowding and poor housing.	1
The problem, however, remains how such universals are produced from the multiplicity of initiating individual praxes.	1
The products of a conflict, as well as its residues, may seem incomprehensible insofar as they differ from the original intentions of any of the combatants.	0

The project team collaborated with teachers in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the Greater Manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed to improve girls' attitudes to the physical sciences and technical subjects.	1
The psychological and moral elements of political action were almost the only ones to appear here, which is why intellectuals least inclined to politics were to be seen in the Resistance.	1

The raw materials might have been there before â indeed, hadn't it been she, Arlene, who had spotted them?	1
The real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization.	1
The recognition that children can not simply be written off in the rationality stakes and can not therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they can not, therefore, be denied it on any account.	1
The rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science, and that girls were keen to know more about nature, the environment and medical science.	1

The smell released by a pig or chicken farm is indescribable, and can affect 10 square miles of countryside around.	1
The sounds are the same as those of daylight, yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block, the sigh of air over a shroud, the stretching of a sail, the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull, the curl of a quarter-wave falling away, and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness.	1
The subject of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but has to show the referee was upto no good: spite, ill-will or some improper motive will do.	1
The summer's sprawl begins to be oppressive at this stage in the year and trigger fingers are itching to snip back overgrown mallows, clear out the mildewing foliage of golden rod and reduce the overpowering bulk of bullyboy ground cover.	1
The supertram is, in effect, a low-cost replacement for British Rail's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains, those rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spotters.	1
The survey of children's attitudes helped here: research such as Ormerod's( 1971; Ormerod and Duckworth, 1975) had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science, but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice.	1
The throng of Masai surrounds them.	0
The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous; that is, on a standard interpretation, they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals.	1
The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense.	1

The youth â¦ is capable of having principles; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated, and he is able to attend to his own refinement.	1
The â detour, of Stalinism is thus formalized as Marxism's own descent into its unconscious, resulting in a dream-work of heterogeneous histories that have eluded systematization and subsumption into the single meaning of Marxism's own reading of history.	1

Their paramedical skills cover highly technical procedures: intubation, infusion and defebrillation.	1
Their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them, but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene.	1
Then certain teachers were particularly struck by the evidence of large differences in the interests and experience children brought with them to school.	1

There ain't no pill to get you off the powder, Mr Breakspear, only will power.	1
There are a number of points to bear in mind.	1
There are always accusations of piracy and copy-catting, though they can't usually be substantiated.	0
There are so many combinations of what to have, what to get, what we can't get, what we need really I think is, what we need is obviously going to be priority isn't it?	0
There are strict time limits: generally, six years from when damage first occurred; where the damage was initially â latent you are given longer â three years from when you could have discovered it, with a longstop of 15 years.	1
There are three key causes of the shambles: Mr Kenneth Clarke; the failure to separate emergency from non-emergency work; and the Whitley Council negotiating machinery.	0
There are, of course, the familiar and obvious reasons connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too.	1
There is a refreshing simplicity and tenderness in Motion's account of the way Francis nurses her, but she herself is too sketchily drawn for the episode to carry much weight.	1
There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career( Douvan and Adelson, 1966).	0
There is more greenery further south in the deep forest of Chize( with the fine Renaissance chateau of Dampierre-sur-Boutonne at its edge); and more marshes to the west around Rochefort and Marennes, where those mussels and oysters are raised.	1
There is no mention in the education policy of how that might affect the Department of Education and Science.	0
There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle.	0
There is still endless dithering on how broad a â safety net Britain will extend to its citizens.	1
There is still time for GMA( GEC, Mowlem, Amec and Greater Manchester Buses) to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer.	1
There is, therefore, before any understanding of historic agents and movements, a certain aporia in all social ensembles: from afar they may appear whole, but close to, they can be seen as riddled with holes.	1
There was a fault on the computer governing the plant, said Mr Wheeler, and the fire had automatically shut down.	1

There was no difference between the liquid in these drums and the liquid in the cargoes they refused to touch.	0

There were new tricks of modelling to be learned too â how to remove a coat, sliding It carefully off her shoulders with the sleeves hanging in perfect balance, never for one moment allowing the inside to be on view, for samples were often unlined.	0
There would be Skills UK â a locally structured training commission â a Fair Wages Commission, a Health Technology Commission, a Health Quality Commission, an Education Standards Council, an Independent Sentencing Council, a Children's Commissioner, an Environmental Protection Executive, and a Social Insurance Fund administered by â¦ â an independent commission.	1
There would in addition be a minister for Science and Technology at the newly supreme DTI, with responsibility for determing investment in research.	1
There's a war, the Germans are trying to kill every Jew in the world and you are going to hang one Masai because of a misunderstanding.	0
There's also a Renaissance fountain, and an extremely odd conglomeration of church buildings comprising one ancient ruin, one proper church, and the skeleton faade and nave of a rather pompous and unfinished 18th-century abbey.	0
There's another wasted area.	0

Thereafter, there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period.	1
These are all referred to as â supertram networks, the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessors.	0
These decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty.	1
These differences can be seen quite early on; we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers.	1
These examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science: it builds on girls' interests, not just boys'; it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists, and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science.	1
These explanations see the delinquent individual as inherently more prone to criminal behaviour than the non-delinquent.	1
These pipes stretching thinly in a bridge across the service road injected a mix of chemicals into the walls of the furnace itself; did I know that fuel was only used in the start-up process, after which the chemicals themselves provided the fire?	1
These stress the importance of family relationships and upbringing during the early years, and conclude that anti-social, and by implication criminal, behaviour results from faulty personality development.	1
These theories share certain similarities with biological explanations.	1
These two suggestions, far from being enlightened liberation of all children, are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some, and Harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise.	1
They also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates, flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights.	1
They also had slightly more positive attitudes towards science and scientists and were less likely to define them as exclusively masculine.	1
They are approaching the fire.	0
They are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues; the meaning of life, the existence of God, ideologies, their emerging sexuality, their future career and life-style â too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates.	1
They are based on the idea that criminal behaviour is either inherited or a consequence of unique, individual experiences.	1
They are sitting on stools in the middle of the cattle enclosure talking to Tepilit's father, Sentue.	0
They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons, and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all.	1
They briefly appeared on deck for lunch; a meal which Rickie hardly touched, while Robin-Anne, despite her apparent frailty, attacked the sandwiches and salad with the savagery of a starving bear.	1

They will also tend to be authoritarian, conservative and controlled in their thinking.	0
They will kill him.	0
They will perform some of the same functions, but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams.	1
They will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions, including much such expression in the arts, as being soft and feminine.	1

Think up a good think for sponsor.	0
This allows Sartre to include chance and contingency in his scheme.	1
This chapter will examine a range of theories which attempt to explain such behaviour.	1
This condition is known as foreclosure.	0
This drives the spear almost completely through his body.	0
This increasingly comes to resemble nothing so much as Sartre's own account of History.	1
This is also the view put forward by John Harris, though in less specific terms.	0
This is what the House of Lords decided in two cases last April in spite of an attempt to get the valuers off the hook by a disclaimer which said: â I accept that the valuer does not warrant anything stated in his report as being accurate â¦	1
This leaves the Energy Secretary, Mr John Wakeham, with two options: he can either agree to underwrite any cost escalations in nuclear handling costs after privatisation, or he can swallow his pride, and pull all nuclear plant out of the impending sale.	1
This little group begins to mount a hill.	0
This man was very much liked by the Masai.	0

This market sensitive dispute has taken place as President Bush and Congress continued to spar on a primary cause for government borrowing â the budget deficit.	1
This means that first, they lead to results, and second, that the internal structure of social objects contains â the double negation of themselves and of each constituent part by the other( II, 22).	1
This means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide range of courses in further and higher education and for entry to occupations requiring a scientific or technical base.	1
This model seems to explain our observations.	1
This model was originally postulated by Erikson( 1965) and then developed by Marcia( 1966 and 1976).	0
This one was in soft light green with a boxy shaped jacket and narrow skirt and the same green-and-white check material of the little sleeveless blouse had been used to line the jacket and face the wide reveres.	1
This piece of wood passes right through Turnbull, so that he is skewered.	0
This strategy marks a structure of repetition in Sartre's text: each time he poses the question of how there can be totalization of History without a totalizer, he retreats to a more limited example whose unity is already evident, but which in the end only brings him back to the original question again.	1
This time the pause was almost eloquent, then he gave a richly contagious laugh.	1
This told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring â female domestic interests in science would probably meet with failure.	1
This trick took hours of practice, up and down the landing at the hostel while the other girls looked at her as if she had taken leave of her senses.	1
This view, as we shall see, has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings.	1
This violent event, described at length in hysterically colourful terms, is the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plot.	1
This was her very first taste of only the best being good enough â and she liked it!	0
This woman has come from far away to write about your people.	0
This would, necessarily, ignore the fact that many criminals do not go to prison, and that, perhaps, people in prison are not always criminal.	1
This, Paula soon discovered, was the way of the fashion world â a constant frantic rush against the clock, to have collections ready on time or to complete individual couture garments for customers who always considered their order more urgent, more important, than that of anyone else.	1
This, of course, is a popular subject: it seems particularly attractive to the poet-turned-novelist because of the scope it offers for the tremulously sensitive probing of feelings.	1
Those animals are accustomed to the Masai.	0
Those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papers.	0
Those people are victims, too, but they have certainly kept us together.	1
Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury.	1
Though I don't suppose I could afford to pay you as well as Mattli does â yet.	0
Though he was always in evidence it was invariably Madame who did all the talking, giving orders, fussing around clients, so that Paula was never quite certain what his role was.	1
Though individuals are nailed, the greatest villain of all is the system.	1
Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him, it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts, â totalizations, can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality â rather than being the arbitrary, blind and self-cancelling movements of, say, Hardy's immanent will.	1
Thought you might know a and all, in about five minutes!	0

Throughout we should ask ourselves, does this( whatever is being said) apply to her?	1
Throughout, Sartre has nevertheless taken it â for granted that such a totalisation is constantly developing both as History and as historical Truth( I, 822).	1
Thus were explained anatomically the enormous jaws, high cheek bones, prominent superciliary arches, solitary lines on the palms, extreme size of the orbits, handle-shaped or sessile ears found in criminals, savages and apes, insensibility of pain, extremely acute sight, tattooing, excessive idleness, love of orgies and the craving for evil for its own sake â¦	1
Thus, as with biological theories, crime is seen as pathological( a disease), as something to be looked at from the medical point of view.	1
Thus, we will look initially at biological and psychological theories.	1
Time to think?	0
To camouflage the failures of the play, Andy Walmsley has created a set which resembles a pile-up of roadside hoardings: Oldsmobile, Van Heusen shirts, Texaco Premium Type.	0
To do the mince pies.	0
To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them, unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination.	0
To summarise, these biological and psychological theories hold that the criminal is a particular type of person, apart from the rest of society and with a special predisposition toward criminal behaviour.	1
To the Tysons, that meant nothing extravagant â just an extra £135 a month to make life at home in South Ruislip, Middlesex easier.	1
To the north, where Poitou borders on the Vendee, shapely clumps of trees are almost the only punctuation marks on widespreading marshy landscapes; to the south it bubbles with little rolling hills.	1
To the sentence stem â When a child will not join in group activities â¦, these boys gave responses like â he is selfish, â he must be stupid, â he deserves to be unpopular.	1

Today's attraction-merchants are doing no more to lure 20th-century tourists than their medieval forebears did for pilgrims.	0
Today, Sartre's voluntarism is to some extent returning to favour as the result of a desire to retrieve the categories of agency and the subject, which goes together with the wish to get out of the apparently totalizing systems of Adorno, Althusser or Foucault.	1

Under strain for a start because it was technically ill-equipped to avert disaster or to cope with the consequences when disaster struck; under strain from commercial pressures which, as the inquiry puts it, â compromised safety; under strain above all because the people on the spot couldn't or wouldn't cope, were weary from gruesome working hours( the senior signal technician who heads the list of the culpable had had only one day off in the past 13 weeks), lacked adequate training, or simply couldn't be bothered.	1
Unfortunately the district officer stepped forward.	0
Unfortunately, this evidence has tended to be fragmentary, a collection of separate, discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power.	1

Unless the change in image was immense, boys would probably not be affected, science would still be an obvious, acceptable choice for a boy.	0
Unless they can say something relevant in the next four days, the many Hong Kong critics who believe the visit is a waste of dollars will be absolutely right.	0
Unlike Luk¡cs' insignificant event from which the universal is precariously drawn out through the narrative, Sartre's singularity works synecdochally in a conventional antinomy with the universal, the relation between the two structured according to the familiar nineteenth-century model of organic growth or process in which each singular event makes up the whole while, as he puts it, â the whole is entirely present in the part as its present meaning and as its destiny.	1
Unlike some couturiers Madame did not mind if her model girls did not have the same colour hair but she did insist on identical styles.	0
Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention.	1

Until this year, the three independent review bodies which make recommendations for nurses, doctors and the professions allied to medicine have given much higher awards than the Whitley Councils.	1
Unwilling to follow Merleau-Ponty by dropping the second in favour of the first, Sartre argued that it was possible for man to be both at once through the movement of praxis, that is intentional actions which produce material effects.	1

VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways: both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist, and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science, an element too often missing from science at school.	1

We can consider three possible changes:	1
We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous?	0
We can hardly do justice to the wide scope of psychological theories here, but there are some basic ideas and assumptions which underlie such theorizing.	0
We can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools.	1

We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add.	1
We must show that it is possible for it to be both a resultant â¦ and a totalizing force â¦ how it can continually bring about the unity of dispersive profusion and integration.	1

What Andrew Motion presents us with here is a static and humourless mood-piece filled with over-elaborate imagery.	1
What Sartre needs to demonstrate, therefore, is that if the law of the dialectic works from the individual level, overall it produces nothing less than the intelligibility or the meaning of History as such:	1

Whatever else such a strategy may achieve, it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which, unless they can be defended, gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness.	1
Whatever the outcome, the Government's willingness to continue pushing through the float during this Parliament shows how ministers are prepared to put political expediency before the interests of the industry.	1

While he suggests in apocalyptic tones in The Problem of Method that this process of self-consciousness is at last beginning to take place, and that civil, foreign and colonial wars are becoming apparent as different forms of a single class struggle, Sartre also admits that the divorce between theory and praxis which ensued under Stalinism has generally prevented any clear self-consciousness among the masses.	1
While new departments are born and others extended, one of the oldest â the Home Office â would become a shadow of its present self.	1
While some genetic influence can not be ruled out, just what is inherited remains very unclear.	1
While some offenders suffer from mental disorders the vast majority do not.	0
While such notions may all contains some elements of truth, they are by no means complete explanations of criminal behaviour.	1

Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species.	1
Yet each individual bout articulates itself within the framework of the history of boxing, known and unknown.	1
Yet he did not oppose all toxic waste movement( after all, the same union represents workers at Rechem itself); he simply didn't like the idea that big industrial nations like Canada could dump their dirty problems on this country and his members.	1
Yet it was Mr Clarke, not Mr Nichol, who was involved in the critical decisions â the cash limit for the NHS, the 6.5 per cent offer to ambulance workers( compared to seven per cent for nurses, eight per cent for doctors and nine per cent for ancillary workers); and today's introduction of military ambulances.	1
Yet the ambulance worker is only being offered £10,000, when a fire officer is being given £13,000 and a Metropolitan police constable can earn £25,000.	0
Yet yesterday's report on the Clapham crash, confirming the picture which emerged throughout the Hidden inquiry, makes an event which seemed at the time totally unexpected look almost inevitable.	1

Your people do not believe it is right to offer cows to his family.	0

so he's killing himself laughing I I've got to tell you Ron, I've been taping he said I don't give a monkeys you tape what, he said let them all hear, they'll all be able to pass it round!	1
sort of sit there putting what the solicitor said in your	1
sorted out.	1
take you up.	0
that, that just makes the total picture just different altogether.	1
the zone starts the zone starts there, thirty.	0
they all sit there looking at her and saying bloody hell she ain't got her own hat on, we've been here quarter of an hour and she walks in the door, takes her coat off and says come on ladies you're suppose to be off your hind by two o'clock, leaving here at two	1
they can't pursue it till we come back to them.	1
they must have been putting two thousand in you know	1
they'll say well you, it's awful, you're awfully sorry but it's.	0
they're not, they're not little either, I saw a film and it was hanging past his knee caps	0
they're treating alcohol as food.	1
they've put twelve, thirteen hundred in.	1
thinking we'll soon get them and save you carrying it tomorrow, then.	1
this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties.	1
thus one can and must say â¦ that each fight is the singularisation of all the circumstances of the social whole in movement and that by this singularisation, it incarnates the enveloping totalization which the historical process is.	1

to go over don't they?	1

today running over cyclists out the way.	0
too expensive I think.	0

where's the estate agents anyway, you're going to here?	0
why what you speak to me, what were you saying?	0
why you like you like to	0
wipe it off but nobody knows who you are anyway so what difference does it make?	1
words that people are using I've got now, so I don't even think of it, it's just there and I just talk normal that's the idea really and if anybody asks you what you're doing, then you tell them and it and you say, if you don't wish to be on it, well	0
yeah that's it.	0

you did say that you'd like to come.	0
you know I need new glasses or something, you know that's how I feel.	1
you know like it is.	0
you know that kind of thing oh they had to pay a la carte.	0
you know, big wooden	0
you know, leaning over the balcony and all that sort of er	0
you see put John, one of us start trussing early but we didn't need one Ann's got another team in the other room doing it.	1
you tell her.	0
â A lighthouse? he asked in a voice which suggested that a prudent man avoided such things.	1
â Alas, disclaimers may work if, for example, the property being valued is industrial or an expensive house.	1
â All that happens in the play is based on fact, Janes pledges solemnly in the programme notes.	1
â And I had to lose a good, good woman before I came to my senses.	1
â And I'm sure one day you'll find him.	0
â And it's even harder, Jackson Chatterton's voice was suddenly sinister, â for a poor person who has no one to help them.	0
â And you told him to give himself up?	0
â Anything to help a friend.	0
â Anyway, you've got me now so you can get rid of her.	1
â Are they milk cattle living in a house as I have heard?	0
â As far as I know them.	0
â As we know, truth is often stranger than fiction.	0
â Because you have come here my son is going to be killed.	0
â Bourbon, he explained laconically.	0
â But Gary â I haven't been spying for you!	0
â But I would never mention anything I have seen here!	0
â But you still got off cocaine?	1
â Can I have a little time to think it over?	0
â Can I read his statement?	0
â Can we be sure Robin-Anne didn't bring any of the drug aboard?	0
â Can you manage a brandy and soda?	1
â Cheers, I said.	0
â Claudia, you are supposed to understand them.	0
â Coming off cocaine isn't like that.	1
â Determined to die.	0
â Did you accept any gifts?	0
â Did you know this man?	0
â Did you see him after the killing?	0
â Do not thank me.	0
â Do you realize what will happen to you if you are tried?	0
â Do you speak Masai?	0
â Does that mean they'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging?	1
â Don't worry.	1
â Don't you approve of that?	0
â Either I have your word on It or I am afraid you can no longer remain in my employ.	0
â Even salmon, he assured me, â but of course those are protected and must be thrown back.	0
â For goodness sake stop panicking!	0
â Gary Oliver is a friend, she said defensively.	0
â Gary! she objected, shocked.	0
â Go in peace.	0
â Having trouble? a voice beside her asked.	1
â He came to my house and told me what had happened.	0
â He told me you two were pakiteng, little heifers.	0
â He was very sick after the lion got him and he gave me his necklace.	0
â He will not talk to his son.	0
â He would not agree?	0
â He's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out Phys Ed basketball-playing retard, Ellen said scornfully, â by which I mean that he's a jock with the brains of a dung beetle.	0
â How can Fahfakhs save him?	0
â How long will it take, anyway?	1
â I am afraid I do expect it, Paula, in this case.	0
â I am here because I was asked to come by Claudia.	0
â I am so glad you came.	0
â I can't promise not to see Gary again.	0
â I can't see any point in that.	1
â I do not pay you to have friends in rival fashion houses.	0
â I don't believe it!	0
â I don't earn that much!	0
â I don't know.	0
â I feel appalled by the way these professional guardians have treated us.	1
â I felt it was so safe, they were so professional, said Mr Tyson.	1
â I guess you can guess, he said.	0
â I hadn't planned to work at all.	1
â I have a very important assignment for you, Paula, Arlene Frampton-Cox said.	0
â I have been asked to supply the models and I would like you to be one of them.	1
â I have been watching you work, Madame Mattli said directly.	0
â I have never betrayed any confidence and I never will.	1
â I have offered cattle to his family.	0
â I have prepared the lunch.	0
â I hear you have been seen going into the House of Oliver, she said, her immaculately painted lips tight with fury.	1
â I hope you are well, Tepilit ole Saibol.	0
â I just guess I'm not hungry.	0
â I killed him on purpose.	0
â I knew his family well.	0
â I noticed that Rickie wasn't eating today, I said, â but Robin-Anne was?	0
â I only hope you're right! he said in anguished tones.	0
â I shall be sorry to lose you, Paula.	1
â I think she'd do better to understand herself, Ellen said tartly.	0
â I think so.	0
â I thought you'd never ask.	0
â I told my son only trouble could come from being your pakiteng.	1
â I told you â I've left Mattli.	1
â I will bring you two cattle tomorrow.	0
â I will do what I can, I promise.	0
â I will try.	0
â I won't forget.	0
â I won't, she promised, glancing at her watch.	0
â I wrote it for you, he assures his gal before the ballads, but how can you tell?	0
â I'd have liked to have had Rickie Crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes.	0
â I'll go and see him tomorrow.	0
â I'll need it.	0
â I'll talk to him.	0
â I'm afraid it's gone off to the High Court, sir.	1
â I'm just asking.	0
â I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.	1
â I've left Mattli, she said.	1
â If we do it properly any spot is the right spot, he insisted.	0
â If you have been reasonable, if you are offering your own wealth, two cows instead of one, and he will not listen, if he thinks you are a small man and will not listen to your suggestions, why not?	0
â If you say that at your trial, they will kill you.	0
â It ain't bad being aboard, he said, and held out his hand and, not before time, we shook.	0
â It is that hard, he said ominously, and I thought of John Maggovertski's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder.	0
â It may seem a little odd for prison staff to be looking at their prisoners as customers, but they are the direct consumers of our service, explained Mr Stephen Twinn, prison director, who spent 23 years in the public sector at various grades of prison governor.	1
â It was about 8.30am and I was just getting dressed when it came over on the news, said Mr Tyson, a former clerk of works at Harrow council, London.	1
â It won't be easy, â he said grimly, and I was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn Chatterton aboard.	0
â It's called the Hole in the Wall.	0
â It's not arranged yet.	0
â Its main concerns would become food and the people who consume it, not farming and those who produce it.	0
â Kind of starving, she justified her theft, then poured herself some diet soda.	1
â Laibon, great-grandson of Mbatian, you must think again.	0
â Little one, I would like to speak with you.	0
â Madame Mattli will be coming to Bristol herself, Arlene continued.	0
â Many of my people saw me.	0
â Marxism, on the other hand, Sartre claims, â is History itself becoming conscious of itself( I, 40): as for Luk¡cs, it is by becoming conscious of itself as the subject of history that the working class will understand history's meaning â and so recognize itself as the meaning of history.	1
â My father was an industrial chemist and he said if you want to go and work for them, go and work for them.	0
â My heart is breaking, she says.	1
â Never has homo faber better understood that he has made history and never has he felt so powerless before history.	1
â No, I'm here to make a report to the governor.	1
â No, idiot â not so that I can steal them.	1
â No, no, please.	0
â No, sir, but we got the Larusa translator in.	0
â Not once but several times, he added.	1
â Now that they can't get hold of cocaine they'll just crash out.	1
â Now, do you want to tell me all the facts?	0
â Oh hell, I shall have to go.	0
â Oh yes, Paula said, brimming with suppressed excitement.	1
â Ole Sentue, I agree with you.	0
â Our people also fought the Germans.	0
â Please God.	0
â Promise you'll look in and say hello when you have time.	0
â Rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago, which means he's probably already over the crash period.	1
â See if you can rustle up a cup of tea for Paula and me, please.	1
â Shall we sit over there in the corner?	0
â Shall we take some coffee now?	1
â She allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug, so she can only blame herself for her predicament.	0
â She must first ask her father who lives far away.	0
â She won't have done that, Chatterton said with conviction.	0
â She's the best I could get â¦	0
â Stand up man.	0
â Sure they tried, they tried real hard, but back then I didn't	0
â Take the animal now, he says to his assistant gently.	0
â Taylors have a certain amount of stock but she will be bringing extra samples from London especially for the show.	0
â Tell him I am very sorry, but I must fill the quota.	1
â Thank you, Paula said faintly.	0
â That girl is serious about giving it up, real serious, heavy serious!	0
â That's what they used to say about women is not a proof that saying it about a child is false.	1
â The Masai are brave.	0
â The cells are luxurious compared to some of the things we put up with in the Army, said one staff member during a Press tour of the jail.	0
â The crux of our argument is that we don't need to have toxic wastes and the fact that plants like Rechem exist, providing easy options for companies, is acting as a disincentive for companies to clean up.	1
â The difficult bit starts two or three days later.	0
â The next day he presented himself for arrest.	0
â The plant should be relocated because it's in the wrong place, Llew Smith, the local Euro-MP, told me.	0
â The priority of MAFF must become food, not farming, the policy review says.	1
â The rich trash pay the bills, Mr Breakspear, which lets me give my spare time away to the poor trash.	1
â The same as you I expect, Paula â getting my strength up to face the rest of the day.	1
â There is no incinerator which completely destroys toxic wastes, Madeleine Cobbing, Greenpeace's toxics campaigner, told me.	0
â There is nothing wrong with milking cows and goats.	0
â They are dedicated people who clearly know what they are talking about and have guided us through it.	1
â They don't like cattle.	0
â They won't give you any grief in the next few days, he said.	1
â Think about what I said.	0
â Umm â¦ not a part of France we know â¦ where exactly is it?	0
â Want some?	0
â Was it taken down by a policeman?	1
â We are an aggressive company, admitted David Wheeler, operations director at this plant and at Rechem's other incinerator, at Fawley.	1
â We are betrothed.	0
â We are not in the business of polluting the environment, Mr Wheeler insisted.	0
â We are trying to establish the Truth of History'	0
â We got ta take our music more serious, he tells the Crickets, who remain unconvinced.	1
â We know this.	0
â We must keep in touch, Gary said as he finished his cheese roll.	1
â We must run it safely in the short term and long term, he said, â because if people are able to demonstrate that we are causing an environment problem we will be shut down.	1
â We'll have a bit more sea, kick up some spray.	0
