Design : Crossed lines over the toy town tram : City transport could soon be back on the right track , says Jonathan Glancey	1
By JONATHAN GLANCEY	0
MODERN trams , as most continental Europeans know , neither shake nor rattle , nor do they roll .	0
Sleek , solidly built , gentle on the environment , they are often an ideal form of city transport .	1
They also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates , flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights .	1
Trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport invented .	1
The orange-liveried ‘ 1500 ’ series trams in Milan , for example , date from 1927 .	0
Eventually they will be replaced , but more than 60 years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a Swiss watch .	1
They are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore Emmanuele .	1
Last month it was announced that Britain will get its first new-wave trams in 1991 .	0
Destined to run in Manchester , they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre , outlying suburbs and satellite towns of Bury , Altrincham , Salford , Oldham and Rochdale .	1
In Britain , with the main exception of Blackpool ( not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno ) , trams had been largely relegated to the history books .	0
Trams disappeared from most British cities in the 1950s .	0
London 's venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time in 1952 .	0
Somehow the image of the tall , thin , mournful double-deck tram with its wooden body , slatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the British mind .	0
The modern tram is a green machine .	1
Assuming the power station at the end of the line burns cleanly , the tram is virtually pollution free .	1
Standing at traffic lights a Koenig - designed Jumbo is , save for the chatter inside , completely silent .	1
The overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see them .	0
Powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable , the latter far greater than any car .	0
But sadly , there is no indication that the GMA consortium which will design , operate and maintain the first of the new generation British trams in Manchester will share the looks of their Milanese counterparts .	0
They held up the bright new diesel buses and , even worse , blocked the progress of private motorists in bulbous Austins and lumpen Humbers in canyon - like city thoroughfares .	0
They picked up power from a spider 's web of unsightly overhead wires .	0
They were inflexible in operation , draughty , and mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled ‘ Do Not Spit ’ signs screwed to their bulkheads .	0
But the vaporous presences that float through this slender and anaemic first novel by a notable poet would appear to support the claim .	1
The book — which opens a projected sequence of novels that will cover the period from 1968 to the present day — aims to explore what the blurb describes as ‘ the painful transition from youth to adulthood ’ .	1
This violent event , described at length in hysterically colourful terms , is the only piece of history to be woven convincingly into the plot .	1
Other broad hints as to the date are inserted with a comical lack of subtlety : ‘ My God , darling , have you heard ? ’ exclaims Francis 's mother one day as she greets him , ‘ Czechoslovakia .	0
It 's been invaded . ’	0
Motion will have to do better than this if he seriously intends his series of novels to capture the feel of a period .	0
But the book 's principal defect remains the vacuity of its protagonist .	0
He has , however , given him a psychotic compulsion to formulate fanciful similes .	1
Hardly a page goes by without the hapless Francis noticing something which reminds him , improbably , of something else .	1
Sometimes he is reminded of several things .	0
One moment an avenue of chestnut trees looks ‘ like a child 's drawing of ghosts ’ ; the next it appears ‘ frightening but derelict , like extinguished chandeliers ’ ; and finally the chestnuts ‘ prance at him , holding up their gleaming branches like hysterics . ’	1
Such writing rapidly palls , and I hope that in the novels to come , Motion can curb his reckless passion for it .	0
Travel : A pilgrimage sans progress Elisabeth de Stroumillo potters round Poitou	0
PEOPLE tend to look vague when you mention Poitou .	0
‘ Umm … not a part of France we know … where exactly is it ? ’	0
Inland of La Rochelle , you say ; north of Cognac and east of Limoges .	0
You sort of pass it without realising , going to the Dordogne .	0
‘ Ah yes — Cognac .	0
Nice is it ? ’	0
Well , better than that , and one of the best things about it is the fact that so few people , except the French themselves , bother with it .	0
Even for France , the variety to be found is enormous .	0
My passion is for its numerous Romanesque churches , in most cases humbly proportioned but elevated into unique works of art by the richness of their exquisitely - sculpted decoration ; to go to Poitou / Saintonge and not look at any of its churches would be like going to an African game reserve and ignoring the animals .	1
For serious drinkers there is the production of cognac to investigate around Cognac , plus the chance to sample pineau , the powerful local aperitif made from young wine laced with cognac .	0
To the north , where Poitou borders on the Vendee , shapely clumps of trees are almost the only punctuation marks on widespreading marshy landscapes ; to the south it bubbles with little rolling hills .	0
Water is everywhere : canals , streams , small busy rivers with charming names like the Boutonne , the Mignon and the Belle , and big lazy rivers like the Sevre Niortaise and the Charente .	0
The lower reaches of the Sevre Niortaise are swollen with the waters that once covered the whole area , until medieval monks started to dig a spider - web of ditches to drain it .	0
Now the Marais Poitevin is a pleasantly low - profile tourist attraction where you can take canal - boat trips from villages that have hardly changed in the 15 - odd years I 've known them : Maillezais , with a huge and rather dull ruined abbey , and Coulon , where I first ate the delicious local version of moules marinieres called mouclade .	1
A century later , it had an adoptive daughter to weep for : 20 - year - old Marie Mancini , niece of Louis XIV 's minister Mazarin .	0
She went there when her romance with the young king was quashed for political reasons .	0
Months later , when Marie had departed , Louis is said to have paused nostalgically at Brouage on his way to Paris after marrying the Spanish Infanta at St Jean - de - Luz .	0
As you come back from Brouage towards St Jean - d'Angely — on the D18 via the canalside village of Pont - l'Abbe - d'Arnoult , with a lovely Romanesque church faade — a sign at the junction of the D122 points you to the chateau whose improbably perfect lake and gardens stare at you from posters throughout the region : La Roche Courbon .	0
Its most surprising room , covered from ceiling to floor in 17th - century paintings , should be a salon or library ; instead , a dotty stone bathtub was set into one wall at a later date by a lady called Charlotte .	0
Wriggling across country on the D216 to Port - d'Envaux , you come to two more chateaux : 18th - century Panloy , flaking romantically away on its hillock overlooking a bend in the Charente and , almost next door , the much older , moated Crazannes , half - smothered in amazing flamboyant Gothic carving .	1
Crossing the autoroute and turning north on the D127 brings you to St Jean - d'Angely by way of the isolated church of Fenioux .	0
Its conically - roofed tower , hugged about by a brood of smaller roofs shaped like candle snuffers , is visible for miles .	1
St Jean - d'Angely is a charming little town : there are good shops as well as half - timbered houses along its narrow old streets , one spanned by an ancient bell - tower .	1
There 's also a Renaissance fountain , and an extremely odd conglomeration of church buildings comprising one ancient ruin , one proper church , and the skeleton faade and nave of a rather pompous and unfinished 18th - century abbey .	0
It makes a conveniently central hub : the Marais Poitevin village of Coulon is 27 miles to the north by the D120 , which inexplicably changes its number at the top of a hill to D115 .	0
Niort is about the same distance by the parallel N150 .	0
Saintes , with Gallo - Roman remains , a beautiful Romanesque abbey and an atmospheric medieval quarter , is 17 miles south of St Jean ; 15 - odd miles to the north - west is Surgeres , all of whose public buildings , including an engagingly asymmetrical church , are within the 16th - century castle walls , scattered among beautiful gardens and parkland — perfect for picnicking .	1
Just under 10 miles south - west of St Jean , on the Brouage road , St - Savinien is at the upper limit of the tidal reaches of the Charente .	0
The villagers ' main hobby seems to be fishing with peculiar , saucer - shaped nets suspended from precariously - perched bankside huts .	0
One fisherman waxed lyrical about the variety of fish in the river .	0
‘ Even salmon , ’ he assured me , ‘ but of course those are protected and must be thrown back .	0
Which they are … normalement . ’	0
Like almost every other Poitevin town and village , St - Savinien has a sweet Romanesque church ; Melle , indeed has three .	0
But Aulnay , just over 10 miles north - east of St Jean , is probably the best , its unassuming architecture a perfect frame for the sheer artistry of the carvings round its doors and windows .	1
Biblical motifs recur — some art - experts call them sermons in stone , and their messages would certainly have been clear to the often - illiterate medieval pilgrims trudging to Santiago de Compostela in Spain .	1
But these themes are always interspersed with more fanciful ones : grimacing masks , weird animals , exuberant abstract patterns .	0
I think those 10th - and 11th - century sculptors were motivated not just by piety but also by a certain competitive spirit : if a church was finer than the one in the next village , more pilgrims would surely pause there .	0
Today 's attraction - merchants are doing no more to lure 20th - century tourists than their medieval forebears did for pilgrims .	0
Law : Always take along a friend to sue : Litigation can pay off even in the unlikeliest circumstances .	0
WHEN things go wrong you can sue more often than you may think .	0
Money may not have changed hands .	0
Someone may have even done you a favour .	0
It does n't matter .	0
As long as you can show that they owed you a legal duty to be careful and have been negligent , damages could come your way .	0
There are a number of points to bear in mind .	0
Take up references before giving credit , lending money , letting in tenants , taking on staff .	0
Ask banks , building societies , former landlords , present and past employers .	0
If you rely to your detriment on a misleading reference which was given negligently , you should be able to sue the referee .	0
The subject of a bad reference can sue the referee for libel but has to show the referee was upto no good : spite , ill - will or some improper motive will do .	0
Take along a prosperous adviser on all shopping sprees , demonstrate a high degree of trust and strong reliance in what they say and you may have unexpected protection should the seller go out of business and the goods fall to pieces .	0
A 26 - year - old woman accountant who knew nothing about the mechanical side of vehicles asked her more knowledgeable friend to find a car for her .	0
She stipulated that it must never have been involved in an accident .	0
The friend found one at a garage .	0
Although he failed to check it had been accident - free , he assured the lady that this was the case .	0
She bought it .	0
It had been in an accident and it was worthless .	0
In May last year the Court of Appeal upheld a judgment against the friend for more than £5,500 damages for negligence because he had owed the accountant a duty of care .	0
Your conservatory collapses as a result of negligence of the professionals who were engaged by the previous owner to put it up .	0
You can sue the professionals — builders , architects , surveyors or engineers — by courtesy of the Defective Premises Act 1972 , despite the fact that you never had a contract with them yourself .	0
There are strict time limits : generally , six years from when damage first occurred ; where the damage was initially ‘ latent ’ you are given longer — three years from when you could have discovered it , with a longstop of 15 years .	0
